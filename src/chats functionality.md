1. **Initial State**:
When the chat widget opens, it shows an initial welcome message:
```jsx
"ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm your FastFind AI assistant. I can help you:
â€¢ Find properties that match your preferences
â€¢ Answer questions about specific properties
â€¢ Provide detailed information about locations
â€¢ Compare different properties"
```

2. **User Input Methods**:
- Text input
- Voice input (using browser's speech recognition)
- Pre-defined suggestion buttons (like "Find properties under â‚¦5M", "Show luxury homes", etc.)

3. **Chat API Integration**:
Here's the key part - when a user sends a message, it makes a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/chat` with the following data:
```javascript
{
  message: messageText,
  userId: 'user123',
  propertyId: propertyId,  // Optional - used when asking about specific property
  conversationHistory: messages.slice(-5) // Last 5 messages for context
}
```

Let me check the server-side chat implementation:

Let me get more of the chat implementation:

Now I can explain exactly how the chat is supposed to work:

1. **Message Processing Flow**:
   - When a user sends a message, it goes through several processing steps:
     a. **NLP Analysis** - Analyzes the message for:
        - Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
        - Entities (locations, prices, dates, etc.)
     b. **Intent Prediction** - Uses a trained model to understand what the user wants
     c. **Property Filtering** - Based on the analysis, it filters relevant properties

2. **Two Main Chat Modes**:
   a. **Specific Property Mode**:
   - When `propertyId` is provided (user clicks on "Chat about this property")
   - Only provides information about that specific property
   - Can answer detailed questions about that property

   b. **General Search Mode**:
   - When no `propertyId` is provided
   - Filters properties based on user's criteria:
     - Location mentions
     - Price ranges (e.g., "under â‚¦5M")
     - Property types
     - Amenities
     - Other features

3. **AI Response Generation**:
   - Uses Google's Gemini AI model (gemini-pro)
   - Creates responses based on:
     - The user's message
     - Filtered relevant properties
     - Chat context (last 5 messages)
     - Pre-defined personality traits (friendly, proactive)

4. **Response Format**:
   The AI's responses include:
   - Natural language response
   - Property cards (when relevant)
   - Links to property details
   - Chat buttons for specific properties
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Detected entities

5. **Special Features**:
   - Handles voice input
   - Provides quick suggestion buttons
   - Shows typing indicators
   - Formats property prices with the â‚¦ symbol
   - Creates clickable property links
   - Supports markdown formatting

So yes, the AI is supposed to use the database properties to:
1. Search and filter properties based on user criteria
2. Provide detailed information about specific properties
3. Answer questions using the property data
4. Make recommendations based on user preferences
5. Guide users through the property search process

The system is designed to be both informative and conversational, helping users find properties while maintaining a natural dialogue flow. It's not just a simple Q&A bot - it's meant to be an interactive assistant that can understand context, remember previous messages, and proactively help users in their property search journey.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this flow in more detail?
